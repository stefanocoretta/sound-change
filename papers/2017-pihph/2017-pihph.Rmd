# Methods

Four simulations were implemented in R [@r-core-team2017] to test the behaviour of the model described in ...
The simulation starts with the creation of a lexicon of 100 lexical items.
50 words are assigned to the BART category, while the remaining 50 to the BAT category.
Within each category, lexical frequency from 1 to 50 is assigned to each lexical item, so that there are a BART and a BAT word of frequency 1, a BART and a BAT word of frequency 2, etc.
